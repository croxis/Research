# Default permissions and abilities for players with no technology researched.
# This is a white-list system.
# The permissions list are what permissions players HAVE (can be ignored if you are using another permission manager)
# The remaining settings are what blocks the player CAN place if they have no tech. 
# If the block or item is not listed, they can not do that action.
# Ranges: the ranges of item ids that are used. Unless using mods like tekkit these should not be changed
